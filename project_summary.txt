Data Release 2 (DR2) presents medium-resolution JWST/NIRSpec spectroscopy of 166 objects spanning 0 < z < 7.5, targeting a mix of star-forming galaxies, quiescent systems, and AGN with a focus on galaxies at cosmic noon (z ∼ 1–3). Observations were obtained with the G140M/F100LP and G235M/F170LP grating/filter pairs. DR2 includes calibrated 2D and 1D spectra, redshift measurements, emission-line catalogs from GELATO and pPXF, and ancillary SED-based properties (see Zhu et al. 2025 for details).
